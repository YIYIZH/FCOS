    """
    Wraps another sampler to yield a mini-batch of indices.
    It enforces that elements from the same group should appear in groups of batch_size.
    It also tries to provide mini-batches which follows an ordering which is
    as close as possible to the ordering from the original sampler.
    Finally it merge two groups alternately one by one.

    Arguments:
        sampler (Sampler): Base sampler.
        batch_size (int): Size of mini-batch.
        drop_uneven (bool): If ``True``, the sampler will drop the batches whose
            size is less than ``batch_size``
